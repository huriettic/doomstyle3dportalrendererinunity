# Doom-style 3D portal renderer in Unity



The project uses Bisqwit's portal rendering tutorial level: [Watch on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQYsFshbkYw)



This repository does not contain any files from Bisqwit's portal rendering tutorial.



My portal rendering uses mathematical planes and clipping triangles, it started from Bunny83's VisPortals project.



To run this project, you’ll need the level file map-clear.txt, which is not included in this repository.



You can get it from the video and put it in the Resources folder in the project.



This project uses code from VisPortals by Bunny83.
